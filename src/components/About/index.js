        <div className="about-page-container">
          <p>
            I am a full-stack software engineer currently studying with the
            School of Code, a 16-week bootcamp that focuses on working in an
            agile team, problem solving skills, and design thinking. From this
            course I have experience in the latest web development technologies.
            I am changing careers from English language teaching to tech.
            Teaching requires clear communication skills, organization, and
            planning, all of which are essential skills in software development.
            My biggest strength is my passion for learning new things.
          </p>
          <p>
            The School of Code is an intensive learning environment. Our core
            stack is React, Node.js / Express, PostgreSQL, and testing with
            Jest. We have also used TypeScript, Docker, Next.js, Cypress, Auth0,
            and Storybook. To supplement my learning, I am pursuing the AWS
            Cloud Practitioner Certification.
